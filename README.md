Hi! I'm Swathi Raghunath, a certified Junior Data Analyst. I have completed a Google-Coursera Certification in Data Analytics. This portfolio will showcse my data analysis skills through the capstone project I completed for my certification.

My first case study is **Cyclistic Bike-share Rider Analysis** which involved end-to-end data analysis process of collecting, preparing, processing, analysing data and sharing insights.


*Case Study:* Understand how Cyclistic bike-share riders use bikes differently

*Business Task:* Recommend strategies to convert casual riders into annual members

*Key Stakeholders:* Cyclistic Executive Team and The director of marketing

*Data Analyzed:* [Historical trip data from July 2021 to June 2022](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)
under the license [Data License Agreement | Divvy Bikes](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)


For this case study I used R for data cleaning & wrangling and Tableau for analysis & visualization.

Refer to my R script in my repository [here](https://github.com/SwathiRaghunath/swathiraghunath.github.io/blob/main/Cyclistic%20Case%20Study%20-%20script%20for%20cleaning%20and%20wrangling.R).

After exporting filtered clean data from R, I proceeded with further analysis on Tableau.

I formatted and added a few more columns to my data to enable visualization. ![Tableau calculations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110858028/183537531-4f3f8ae7-2c13-457a-a068-e2794b2bb853.png)

**SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS**

*Summary*

1. From ride count analysis, it is clear there are more casual riders than members.


2. Members use the bikes more on weekdays compared to weekends.


3. Casual riders and members use the bikes more in summer & spring months than in winter. 


4. Both Members and casual riders use the bikes more during evenings and mornings.


5. Most casual riders start their trips near waterfront/tourist locations, wheras members start their trips in the city's business district. It can be implied that members are mostly office-goers and casual riders use bikes for leisure.


*Recommendations*

To make annual membership more appealing to both user groups, the following marketing strategies can be implemented. 


1. Run discount programs on annual membership packages during summer months when the demand for bikes is significantly high.


2. Offer tiered-annual memebership packages. For example "weekend-access-only membership" and "weekday-access-only membership".  The weekday-access membership will appeal office-goers and the weekend-access will appeal to people who use bikes for leisure.


3. Include exclusive member benefits according to seasons. For example, discounted passes to the tourist attractions in summer months, food coupons or vouchers in winter months.


4. Collaborate with employers in the business district to offer membership discounts to their employees.
