Data Analytics Portfolio

Hi,

I'm Swathi Raghunath, a certified Junior Data Analyst. I aim to showcase the skills i've learned in my Coursera Google Data Analytics Certification on my portfolio.

My first case study is Cyclistic Bike-share Rider Analysis which involved end-to-end data analysis process of collecting, preparing, processing, analysing data and sharing insights.

For this case study I used R for data cleaning & wrangling and Tableau for analysis & visualization.

Refer to my R script in my repository here.

After exporting filtered clean data from R, I proceeded with further analysis on Tableau.

I formatted and added a few more columns to my data to enable visualization. ![Tableau calculations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110858028/183537531-4f3f8ae7-2c13-457a-a068-e2794b2bb853.png)
