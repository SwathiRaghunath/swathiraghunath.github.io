Data Analytics Portfolio

Hi,

I'm Swathi Raghunath, a certified Junior Data Analyst. I aim to showcase the skills i've learned in my Coursera Google Data Analytics Certification on my portfolio.

My first case study is Cyclistic Bike-share Rider Analysis which involved end-to-end data analysis process of collecting, preparing, processing, analysing data and sharing insights.

For this case study I used R for data cleaning & wrangling and Tableau for analysis & visualization.
